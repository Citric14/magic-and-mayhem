//The log in modal comes up when the log in icon is clicked. There is a login and sign up option.
// It will take the email and password of the user, compare them to the database, and let the user in if they match, and send an error if it fails.
//Upon failure, the modal will give an error, but also give the option to sign up. Clicking sign up will take them to the sign up page.
